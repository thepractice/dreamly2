				<h2>What is Dreamly?</h2>
				<p>Dreamly is a platform designed to help you interact  Whether it’s keeping track of your own dreams through the functionality of the dream journal, voting and commenting on other publically posted dreams, or interacting with other members via messaging, Dreamly brings you together with other users on an unconscious level.</p>
			</div>	
			<div id="dream-journal">
				<h2>Why should I keep a dream journal?</h2>
				<p>Both your dreams and your waking life are governed by the rule of perception: you see what you want to see. Consider the case of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_%28viral_phenomenon%29'>The Dress</a>. Looking at the exact same pixels on a screen, some people see a black and blue dress, while others are convinced they see it as white and gold. What is happening is that your perception is filling in the “gaps.” Reality offers a stimulus and you adjust what it is based on how <i>you</i> see it.</p>
				<p>Reflecting on dreams allows you to take a closer look at these “gaps.” What we miss as conscious beings, our unconscious grabs and hold onto. Identifying psychological landmarks along the road to the unconscious brings you face to face with the keynotes that have slipped into these gaps: inner desires, wishes, hopes, and even concerns; matters that are not necessarily brought to your attention in a conscious state of mind.</p>
				<p>Using a journal to capture dreams, ideally as soon as you wake, gives you the chance to log such records and even more critically, accumulate many of them over time for a holistic analysis. Quite simply, keeping a dream journal can improve both your mental, and physical, health by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>giving you better insight on yourself</li>
					<li>connecting you with the fundamental levels of the subconscious</li>
					<li>providing an outlet for underlying stressors, just as any diary or therapeutic channel would</li>
					<li>opening the doorway to dealing with an unresolved past and associated memories</li>
					<li>inspiring creativity and intellect; strokes of genius can sprout from dreams</li>
				</ul>
				<p>You may decide to keep your dreams private, however, Dreamly’s platform also allows for posting dreams publically. Here you can vote other dreams up or down based on what you consider helpful or significant and/or reach out to other respective dreamers for input, as well as to offer your own advice, through commenting and messaging. Your dreams may have more in common with others’ than you realize and this interaction could be the pith of your own healing and eventual subconscious relief.</p>

				<h2>How do I use Dreamly's features?</h2>
				<div id="word-cloud">
					<h3>Word cloud</h3>
					<p>The word cloud is a map of the most frequently appearing words in a collection of dreams. The cloud maps the dreams that are currently displayed on the page. Words that appear together in the same dreams are linked together with gray lines. All of the words in the cloud are clickable links that take you to a page showing only dreams that contain the given word.</p>
					<p>The word cloud is based on the psychological principle of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_%28psychology%29'>free association</a>. The technique, employed by psychologists and creative thinkers alive, is to express anything and everything that pops into your head, no matter how ridiculous or inappropriate it may seem. While such a random <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness_%28psychology%29'>stream of consciousness</a> may appear meaningless, it actually often harbors deep unconscious insights and connections. The German poet Schiller wrote a letter to Freud, explaining that "where there is a creative mind, Reason - so it seems to me - relaxes its watch upon the gates, and the ideas rush in pell-mell". Dreams are the perfect material for free association because their narrative is already partly outside of conscious control. Mapping the word associations in your dreams can reveal connections between ideas, hidden pearls of creative wisdom, and flashes of insight.</p>
					<p>The technology behind the beautiful physics in the word cloud comes from the opensource <a href='http://d3js.org/'>D3 JavaScript library</a>.</p>	
				</div>
				<div id="emoticons">
					<h3>Emoticons</h3>
					<p>Dreamly uses a library of keywords to automatically tag dreams according to seven fundamental emotions (Happy, Sad, Afraid, Desiring, Angry, and Guilty). For example, if the word “crying” appears in your dream, it is tagged as a “Sad” dream. Emotions are displayed as yellow emoticons next to the title of a dream. (Did you know that scientists identify emotions based on facial expression? So emoticons are not just cutesy and fun -- they’re a scientific way to organize emotions!)</p>
					<p>In the sidebar, the emotions of the dreams on the page are shown as emoticons of variable size below the word cloud. So, if there are many “happy” dreams and a few “sad” dreams, a big smiley face will appear next to a smaller sad face. These emoticons are clickable and will filter the dreams in view by emotion. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="hashtags">
					<h3>#Hashtags</h3>
					<p>Just like twitter, you can put a #hashtag before any word in a dream to categorize it. Hashtags of the dreams on the page display in the sidebar below the emoticons. You can see all the trending hashtags at the<a href='http://dreamly.io/hashtags'> hashtag page</a>.</p>
					<p>This is the main method for categorizing and sorting your dreams. For example, dreams of flight you could tag as <a href='http://dreamly.io/hashtags/beauty'>#flying</a> and dreams of indescribable allure and glamor could be tagged under <a href='http://dreamly.io/hashtags/beauty'>#beauty</a>.</p>
				</div>			
				<div id="names">
					<h3>@Names</h3>

					<p>You can put the @ character before any word in your dream to 1) blur the word from public view and 2) track the word across multiple dreams. This is intended mainly to use to anonymyze and track the names of people, places, and things in your dreams. For example, in your dream you would write, “I saw @Ashley across the street from @thewhitehouse.” If the dream is public, other people will see this as “I saw @censored across the street from @censored.” Also, now @Ashley and @thewhitehouse are clickable objects that keep track of your mentions of them across your dreams. These @names appear in the sidebar of your user profile, corresponding to the dreams on the page.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="privacy">
					<h3>Privacy</h3>
					<p>Dreams can reveal your deepest secrets, so we take privacy very seriously at Dreamly. You can choose to make a dream public or private at any time. Information from private dreams will never be shown to anyone except you. You can also use the @ character to censor any word within a public dream.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="impact">
					<h3>Impact</h3>
					<p>Some dreams are trivial, but others are epic sagas revealing the depth and breadth of your soul with a cinematic storyline and vivid visuals. Dreamly lets you differentiate between the two by choosing an “Impact” level setting of “Normal”, “Big”, or “Huge”. Big dreams appear with titles highlighted in yellow. Huge dreams are highlighted in pink.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="voting">
				<h3>Voting</h3>
					<p>Users can upvote or downvote any public dream. The highest voted dreams will display at the top of the page.  For this reason, we encourage you to vote often so the most imaginative and inspiring dreams naturally rise to the top.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="comments">
					<h3>Comments</h3>
					<p>Users can comment on any public dream. The most valuable and comments will be useful dream interpretations. Dreamly will implement a reward system soon where users are rewarded for valuable and insightful interpretations.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="filter-sort">
					<h3>Filter and sort</h3>
					<p>You can sort dreams by “Trending”, “New”, or “Dreamed”. “Trending” uses an algorithm based on the dream’s voting score and time of submission, so that newer, top-voted dreams are displayed first. “New” sorts based on time of submission. “Dreamed” sorts based on the date of the dream.</p>
					<p>You can filter dreams by search term, emotion, and impact level. Entering letters in the search box will automatically start to filter dreams to include only those which include words beginning with the search term. To filter by emotion, choose an emotion from the dropdown menu and the page will update to only show dreams tagged with that emotion. To filter by impact, choose either “Normal”, Substantial, or Epic from the dropdown menu. “Normal” will display all dreams. Substantial will filter to only display substantial and epic dreams. "Epic" will filter to only display epic dreams.</p>	
				</div>
				<div id="follow-other-dreamers">
					<h3>Follow other dreamers</h3>
					<p>Just like twitter, you can follow other users and they can follow you. To follow someone, click the “Follow” button beneath their name. Your <a href='http://dreamly.io/feed'>feed page</a> displays the dreams of people you’re following, as well as your own dreams.</p>
				</div>			
				<div id="notifications">
					<h3>Notifications</h3>
					<p>You are notified when someone comments on your dream or a dream you have commented on, when someone follows you, or when someone you are following posts a dream. Notifications appear with the number of new notifications in the navbar next to the bell icon. Clear your new notifications by clicking on the icon and viewing your <a href='http://dreamly.io/notifications'>notifications page</a>.</p>
				</div>	
				<div id="private-messages">
					<h3>Private messages</h3>
					<p>You can send a private message to any user by clicking the envelope button beneath their name. All of your conversations are shown in your <a href='http://dreamly.io/conversations'>inbox</a>. We encourage users to engage in social therapy via this messaging system. Dreams can act simultaneously as both therapist and patient, sharing their emotions and feelings, and drawing upon each others dreams for analysis.</p>

			<div id="hard-science">
				<h2>What is the hard science about dreaming?</h2>
				<p>As far as scientists and sleep experts can grasp thus far, the basis of dreaming is linked to a stage in the sleep cycle known as REM sleep. After gradually falling into a deeper state of slow wave sleep, at about 90 minutes into the experience, the body enters this stage. Specialized neurotransmitters stop us from getting up and performing the feats that occur during dreams, but otherwise the brain is as responsive as it would be if you were awake. You are essentially paralyzed as part of your visual cortex tries to organize information sent from the cerebral cortex (your memories, your thoughts, and even your conscious endeavors) in order to make sense of the imagery you perceive.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="importance">
				<h2>Why are dreams important?</h2>

				<p>The human psyche consists of two systems running simultaneously: the Conscious and the Subconscious. The Conscious, we experience constantly. We are actively existent in the Conscious moment with everything we do. The Subconscious is of a different cloth. It is a system many times overlooked, lying deep within us; carrying a host of hidden layers of emotion and intention. The greatest human minds have stressed its importance. The greatest human minds—poets, artists, spiritualists, and visionaries alike—have emphasized that what is embedded deep within the psyche bears much more weight in our day-to-day lives than we realize.</p>

				<p>Dreams are the royal road to the unconscious. The unconscious is the layer beneath the two systems of the psyche. By recording and analyzing your dreams, you can reconcile the two systems; bring them into harmony, assimilate the unconscious into consciousness; throw the light of consciousness onto the depths of the subconscious. Health is harmony between the conscious and subconscious systems.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="pleasant-dreams">
				<h2>Why do we have pleasant dreams?</h2>
				<p>Pleasant dreams are the companion of a stress-free mindset. Feeling relaxed and comfortable before going to bed make dreams more positive. We have pleasant dreams because we have let go of the stress built up over what happened during the day.</p>
				<p>But pleasant dreams can arise from moods of deeper provenance. Pleasant dreams can be the result of resolution. Perhaps you have recently let go of a decade-old grudge with one of your best friends growing up. Or maybe you finally donated your time to the homeless shelter that you had been putting off for years due to a job that kept you working late hours on the weekends.</p>
				<p>Pleasant dreams are the rewards of coming to terms with inner conflict that has been bottled up into tension. Pleasant dreams are the achievement of harmony within the self.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="nightmares">
			<h2>Why do we have nightmares?</h2>
				<p>As research suggests, from a physiological standpoint, nightmares can occur because of late-night food consumption which causes an increase in metabolism and consequently energized brain. Again, daily stress can also be a contributor. Although these are facts, the content of your nightmares is more informative than anything else.</p>
				<p>Contrary to pleasant dreams, nightmares hail from disharmony. They are the signals of an activated defense mechanism. The unconscious system is excited to some mode of antagonist, by which it feels it is being attacked. The encroachment doesn’t have to be of physical nature; in modern society your stressors are often the ends of psychological discomfort. Nightmares could arise from the previous example—that decade-old grudge you are still holding onto. It could be the anxiety that you feel knowing that that person has been seeing you in a bad light for so many years. A nightmare could be the result of an insolent boss at work—or even jealousy aroused by an ex-girlfriend who jilted you for someone else.</p>
				<p>Nightmares are the messages of a battered Will. Nightmares are the restless fault lines that are yet to have been stabilized within the soul.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="collective-unconscious">
				<h2>What is the Collective Unconscious?</h2>
				<p>The collective unconscious is the common mental framework and structure that we all share as humans. Because it is the way we all think, it generally goes unnoticed, but scrutiny reveals that this human way of thinking is specific, idiographic, and peculiar -- it is likely that another intelligent species could experience and think about the world in a completely different way than us. The psychologist Carl Jung coined the term collective unconscious and according to him, it is made up of instincts and archetypes. Archetypes are universal symbols like the Wise Old Man, the Mother, the Tower, the Tree of Life, the Fool, the King, the Tyrant, the Monster, the Rogue, etc…, like you would see on tarot cards. Every human culture recognizes and uses these symbols; together with the Instincts they make up the fabric of our reality.</p>
				<p>What happened at the beginning of the Iraq War? According to some, a Tyrant started a needless war for personal gain. Others would say that a benevolent Leader led a campaign to defend American sovereignty. Either way, the experience is that of a story or narrative. This is the way we perceive a coherent, understandable reality.</p>
				<p>Perhaps Time and Space are similar constructs of the collective unconscious -- human ways of understanding and authoring a coherent story from the storm of reality.</p>
				<p>The idea of the collective unconscious explains so much of our history. Why did separate cultures independently form myths involving the flooding and consequent reseeding of the world? The same for stories of a divine savior who would die and be born again? Why do snakes figure so prominently in all mythical traditions and why do modern city-dwellers still dream of snakes? Why did the ancient Greeks and Hindus both arrive at a zodiac where the same stars depicted an archer (Sattitarius) and a water-carrier (Aquarius) even though the constellations do not resemble their namesakes at all? What drove Paul, Constantine, and eventually the rest of the Western world to adopt Christianity. What drove 16th century Europeans to simultaneously reach new heights in art, and what drove 17th century Europeans to simultaneously embrace Reason and the scientific method?</p>
				<p>Dreams are direct conduits to the collective unconscious because, in a dream, you get the human mind (interpreter of reality) operating without the constraints physical reality. The collective unconscious (human mind) is like a lense or machine which receives inputs of physical perception and sensation and produces the output of an interpreted reality or story. In a dream, the input is minimal, so the mind is given free reign and scope to construct entirely new and fresh vistas of reality.<p>
